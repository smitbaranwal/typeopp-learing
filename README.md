## Getting started
```bash
1. Install node from - https://nodejs.org/en/download/
(Make sure the version of node is 8.9.x or later)

2. Install Google Chorome if not installed already

3. Time Travel Debugging -
Download the [Redux Devtools Extension](http://zalmoxisus.github.io/redux-devtools-extension/)

4. IDE => I prefer to use Visual Studio Code.. but any IDE of your choice will be ok. You can install
the Visual Studio Code from here (https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

5. Clone the project from git -
git clone https://github.com/kiranchowdhury/typeopp-learning.git

6. Installing the app -
npm install
cd ibm-ui

7. Steps to run while you are in development mode -
(The Frond end will be served from http-server and the node BFF will be served from Node HTTP Server.
A ng cli proxy has been configured to resolve the cross domeanin security issue.
When you run the app development mode, your change will automatically be published and
browser will be reloaded.)
 - to start the node backend (BFF):
Open a terminal/cmd promt and then run => "npm run node:start"
 - to start the ePricer frontend app:
Open another terminal and then run => "npm run start"
 - Chrome Browser will automatically open and application will be launched

8. Running the app in production mode
(Both the front end and BFF will be serverd from Node Http Server)
 - npm run node:prod
```

## Useful Commands
  * `npm start` - starts a dev server and opens browser with running app
  * `npm run test` - runs lint and tests
  * `npm run watch` - runs tests in watch mode
  * `npm run prod` - runs full prod build and serves prod bundle
  * `npm run prettier` - runs prettier to format whole code base (`.ts` and `.scss`) 
  * `npm run analyze` - runs full prod build and `webpack-bundle-analyzer` to visualize how much code is shipped (dependencies & application)
